      question: "What is a hackathon?",
      answer:
        "Hackathons are collaborative multi-day events where participants (also called hackers) bring their ideas to life by building innovative projects from scratch using software development principals. Aside from just being coding events/competitions, hackathons offer several fun mini-events, educational workshops, sponsor fairs, and an overall great atmosphere to hang out in!",

      question: "How much does it cost?",

      question: "What if I don't know how to code?",
      answer:
        "That's completely fine - in fact, many participants are first time hackers and beginners!",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't have a project idea?",
      answer:
        "You definitely don't need to have an idea beforehand! Remember that your project can come in any form you want - creative, funny, innovative, and more - and you'll have teammates to help ideate during the weekend! You're not required to make a project to attend, but we recommend that you do in order to get the full hackathon experience.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do teams work?",
      answer:
        "There are up to four people per team and you get to choose who you work with, so bring your friends along! Don't worry if you don't have a team; we have a dedicated team formation Discord channel as well as a team formation session at the beginning of the event.",
