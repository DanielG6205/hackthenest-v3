          This April, Hack the Nest invites 250 high school students to a
          36-hour hackathon in the heart of Maryland. Our team has been working
          tirelessly to pack our schedule to the brim with educational
          workshops, exciting side events, and exotic prizes. Whether itâ€™s
          ping-pong without paddles or late-night debugging with cookies, our
          ultimate goal is to host an unforgettable experience for an audience
          of hackers normally barred from hackathons.
